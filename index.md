## Welcome to my campaign!

I was born in 1992 at Methodist Hospital and raised in Arcadia, where I attended school and city recreation programs. This led me to volunteer with Arcadia Recreation Department and collect food for low-income families to attain the rank of Eagle Scout. Having volunteered with Arcadia Recreation, I became an employee with them as an Activity Leader 1, where I supervised youth in after school recreation programs and implemented city - wide events such as the End of Summer of Carnival and Holiday Snow Festival. This was done while attending Pasadena City College, where I advocated for the needs of students by defending the more beneficial current calendar with Winter Intersession, and obtained five Associate Degrees. Transferring to the University of California Riverside, I further advocated for students through improving residential life by hosting educational and social events to help residents succeed as a Residential Halls Association Senator, raising disability awareness as the Vice President of Student Disability Union and lobbying elected officials freeze a 28% tuition rise as a Highlander Lobby Corps Intern. 

After graduating from the University of California Riverside with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics, I served with City Year AmeriCorps in Jacksonville, Florida and New York, New York, where I mentored and tutored students in mathematics and collaborated with school principals and key administrators to design projects beneficial to schools and community respectively. In addition to this work with City Year, I helped my co-teacher obtain her teaching credential by tutoring her in calculus. While I may have gone to Florida and New York for the purpose of service for 1-½ years, Arcadia is always home to me as I moved back to Arcadia after serving with City Year AmeriCorps. Moving back to Arcadia, I started to tutor students through various tutoring companies and eventually became a Special Education Aide at Los Angeles Unified School District, where I assist students academically and emotionally in order for them to succeed. Doing work in various schools, including the two largest school districts in the nation, I want to be a School Board Member for Arcadia Unified School District to be an advocate for and serve the people of my hometown Arcadia. This starts out by making sure that faculty, staff and students have better benefits than they have now. With better benefits, productivity, safety and learning among these groups will significantly improve, as I see that our great district will be a lot better than before. I hope you can join me in this vision and vote for me.
